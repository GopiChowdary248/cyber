# RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection) Tool - Implementation Document

## 1. Objective

Build a comprehensive RASP solution that:
- Monitors and protects applications in real-time during runtime
- Automatically detects, blocks, and reports attacks within the application
- Provides deep visibility into application behavior with low false positives
- Combines the best features from Contrast Security and Imperva

## 2. Key Features

### A. Real-Time Threat Detection & Blocking
- Inline monitoring of requests & responses at runtime
- Detect and block: SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, Path Traversal, Deserialization Attacks
- Zero-day and logic-based attack detection
- Imperva-like automatic mitigation without network-level devices

### B. Context-Aware Protection
- Monitors code execution, libraries, and system calls
- Detects exploits inside the app, not just at the perimeter
- Contrast-like context: knows vulnerable line of code, affected method, parameter, and request

### C. Application-Level Instrumentation
- Agent-based approach for Java, .NET, Python, Node.js
- Hook into application runtime (JVM, CLR, Python interpreter)
- Imperva-like virtual patching without code changes

### D. Advanced Logging & Telemetry
- Detailed attack context: Source IP, User, HTTP request, Stack trace, Vulnerable file/line
- Centralized Dashboard for vulnerabilities, blocked attacks, and live threat feed
- SIEM/SOAR integrations (Splunk, QRadar, Cortex XSOAR)

### E. Machine Learning & Behavior Analysis
- Detect anomalous patterns that signature-based detection misses
- Automatically prioritize threats based on real exploitability

## 3. Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core RASP Agent
1. Develop language-specific runtime hooks:
   - Java: Instrument JVM methods via Java Agent (ByteBuddy, ASM)
   - Python: Wrap sensitive functions (eval, os.system)
   - Node.js: Intercept calls to child_process, fs
2. Capture: HTTP request data, SQL queries, file and command execution attempts

### Phase 2: Detection & Blocking Engine
- Implement real-time rule-based detection
- Add blocking mode to stop malicious execution inline
- Maintain rules in YAML/JSON for dynamic updates

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Reporting
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: React Native (responsive admin dashboard)
- Database: PostgreSQL (vulnerabilities & attacks logs)

### Phase 4: CI/CD & DevSecOps Integration
- Provide API & CLI for pipeline integration
- Support auto virtual patching until fixes are applied

### Phase 5: Advanced Functions
- ML-based anomaly detection for zero-day attacks
- Self-Healing Runtime with auto-sanitization
- Integration with SAST, DAST, and SIEM
