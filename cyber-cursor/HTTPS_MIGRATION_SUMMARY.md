# HTTPS Migration Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to migrate the CyberShield application from HTTP to HTTPS.

## Overview

The application has been successfully migrated from using HTTP to HTTPS for the frontend. The frontend now runs on `https://localhost:3000` and communicates with the backend at `https://localhost:8000`.

#### Production Environment
- **File**: `env.production`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `REACT_APP_API_URL` from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` to `https://localhost:8000/api/v1`
  - Added HTTPS origins to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` including `https://localhost:3000`, `https://localhost:3001`, and `https://frontend:443`

### 4. Docker Configuration

#### Docker Compose
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated frontend environment variables to use HTTPS
  - Added SSL certificate volume mounts
  - Updated port mapping from `3000:80` to `3000:443`
  - Updated backend CORS origins to include HTTPS frontend URLs

### 5. New Scripts Created

#### SSL Certificate Generation
- **File**: `frontend/generate-ssl-certs.ps1` (PowerShell)
- **File**: `frontend/generate-ssl-certs.bat` (Batch)
- **Purpose**: Generate self-signed SSL certificates for development

#### HTTPS Startup Scripts
- **File**: `frontend/start-https.ps1` (PowerShell)
- **File**: `frontend/start-https.bat` (Batch)
- **Purpose**: Start frontend with HTTPS and SSL certificates

#### Simple HTTPS Startup Scripts
- **File**: `frontend/start-https-simple.ps1` (PowerShell)
- **File**: `frontend/start-https-simple.bat` (Batch)
- **Purpose**: Start frontend with HTTPS using React's built-in certificates

#### Setup Scripts
- **File**: `setup-https-frontend.ps1` (Comprehensive setup with OpenSSL)
- **File**: `setup-https-simple.ps1` (Simple setup without OpenSSL)
- **Purpose**: Automated configuration of HTTPS environment

### 6. Documentation

#### Setup Guide
- **File**: `HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for HTTPS setup and configuration

#### Migration Summary
- **File**: `HTTPS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (This document)
- **Purpose**: Summary of all changes made during migration

## Configuration Details

### Frontend HTTPS Configuration
- **URL**: `https://localhost:3000`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://localhost:8000`
- **HTTPS Method**: React's built-in HTTPS with self-signed certificates
- **Port**: 3000

### Backend Configuration
- **URL**: `https://localhost:8000`
- **CORS Origins**: 
  - `http://localhost:3000` (HTTP for backward compatibility)
  - `https://localhost:3000` (HTTPS)
  - `http://localhost:3001` (HTTP for backward compatibility)
  - `https://localhost:3001` (HTTPS)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:8000
HTTPS=true
PORT=3000

# Backend
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,https://localhost:3001
```

## Benefits of HTTPS Migration

1. **Security**: Encrypted communication between frontend and backend
2. **Modern Standards**: Aligns with current web security best practices
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Better support for modern browser features
4. **Production Ready**: Easier transition to production HTTPS deployment

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. Start backend: `python backend/main.py`
2. Start frontend with HTTPS: `cd frontend && .\start-https-simple.ps1`
3. Access frontend at: `https://localhost:3000`
4. Accept self-signed certificate warning in browser

### For Production
1. Install OpenSSL: Download from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
2. Run comprehensive setup: `.\setup-https-frontend.ps1`
3. Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates
4. Update environment variables for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SSL Certificate Warnings**: Accept self-signed certificates in browser
2. **CORS Errors**: Ensure backend CORS includes HTTPS origins
3. **Port Conflicts**: Verify ports 3000 and 8000 are available
4. **Backend Connection**: Ensure backend is running and accessible

### Verification Steps
1. Check backend health: `https://localhost:8000/health`
2. Verify frontend loads: `https://localhost:3000`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API calls are using HTTPS

## File Impact Summary

### Modified Files
- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.ts`
- `backend/app/core/config.py`
- `env.local`
- `env.production`
- `docker-compose.yml`

### New Files
- `frontend/generate-ssl-certs.ps1`
- `frontend/generate-ssl-certs.bat`
- `frontend/start-https.ps1`
- `frontend/start-https.bat`
- `frontend/start-https-simple.ps1`
- `frontend/start-https-simple.bat`
- `setup-https-frontend.ps1`
- `setup-https-simple.ps1`
- `HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `HTTPS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Security Considerations

1. **Self-Signed Certificates**: Only for development use
2. **Production**: Use proper SSL certificates from trusted CAs
3. **Environment Variables**: Keep sensitive data secure
4. **CORS**: Restrict origins in production environments

## Conclusion

The HTTPS migration has been completed successfully. The application now uses HTTPS for frontend-backend communication, providing better security and modern web standards compliance. All necessary configuration files have been updated, and startup scripts have been created to simplify the development process.
